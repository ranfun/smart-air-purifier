# smart-air-purifier
An IoT based smart air purifier that runs on a server and client system. When the client, ESP32 detects high Air Quality Index (AQI) levels.
The server, ESP8266 (connected through MQTT) gets notified and turns on the air purifying system to make the AQI levels normal again. Multiple clients can be connected. 
The hardware files can be found in the gerber file.
